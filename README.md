# Hello! My name is Cameron DeCoster and I love solving puzzles.

I'm always learning about new technologies and trying to build things with them. Right now, I'm working on learning Golang and Kubernetes. Some of the technologies that I enjoy using include:

-   JavaScript
-   React
-   Python
-   Vue

You can see my portfolio [here](https://camdecoster.github.io/portfolio/) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/camerondecoster/). I live in the sunny state of Colorado and this GitHub page is where I host my projects. Check out some of them below!
