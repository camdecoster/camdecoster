# Hello! My name is Cameron DeCoster and I love solving puzzles.

I'm always learning about new technologies and trying to build things with them. Write now, I'm working on learning Golang and Kubernetes. Some of the technologies that I enjoy using include:

-   JavaScript
-   React
-   Python
-   Vue

I live in the sunny state of Colorado and this GitHub page is where I host my projects. Check out some of them below!
