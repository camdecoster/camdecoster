# Hello! My name is Cameron DeCoster and I love solving puzzles.

I'm always learning about new technologies and trying to build things with them. Right now, I'm working on learning about Jenkins and Groovy script. Some of the technologies that I enjoy using include:

- JavaScript
- Vue
- React
- Python

You can see my personal site [here](https://camdecoster.github.io/) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/camerondecoster/). I live in the sunny state of Colorado and this GitHub page is where I host my projects. Check out some of them below!
